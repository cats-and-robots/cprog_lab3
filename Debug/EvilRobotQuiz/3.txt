Assume an object 1m away is visible in both left and right camera in a 
stereo pair. Does the accuracy in the estimated distance to the object 
typically improve, degrade or stay the same with increased base line 
(ie when the distance between the cameras increases)?

#ANSWER:Improved accuracy
#ALT:Degrade accuracy
#ALT:Stay the same
