BACKGROUND STORY

At last, after several years of studying engineering at the university 
you have been accepted to study robotics at a japanese university!
Soon your life-long dream will finally come true...

To visit a cat café. And play with cats. All day long.

You arrive at the hotel in Japan and decides to take a quick nap before
visiting the cat café. But when you wake up, you are outside in the middle
of nowhere!

In front of you is a big mansion. Maybe there is someone inside that can 
help you find your way back (so that you can visit a cat café of course!)...
